# Building APIs Using Django Rest Framework

This guide provides a step-by-step process to build APIs from scratch using Django Rest Framework, making them easy for other developers to consume when creating their own applications.

### Steps

1. **Install Required Packages**
   ```bash
   pip install djangorestframework
   pip install django
   ```

2. **Create APIs in Django**
   - Define the APIs in the `models.py`, `serializers.py`, `views.py`, and `urls.py` files.
   - **Serializers**: Describe the process of converting Python objects to JSON format.

3. **Test the APIs Continuously**
   - Use the following HTTP methods to interact with the API:
     - `GET`
     - `POST`
     - `PUT`
     - `DELETE`
     - `UPDATE`
   - Approach each method based on the specific requirements of your project.

4. **Run the APIs in Django Rest Framework**
   - Ensure Django Rest Framework is set up correctly and your APIs are running smoothly.

5. **Test the APIs on Postman**
   - Use Postman to test the APIs and verify their functionality.
