SECRET_KEY='your-secret-key'
DEBUG=True
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost/db_name
2. Run the Development Server
bash

Edit
python manage.py runserver
The API should now be running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

Usage
1. Accessing the API
Once the server is running, you can access the API at:

bash
Copy
Edit
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/
If you're using Django’s Browsable API, you can use the web interface for testing API requests.

To authenticate via token:

Get a token by POSTing your credentials to /api/token/.

Include the token in the Authorization header for requests:
